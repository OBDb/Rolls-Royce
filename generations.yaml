generations:
  - name: "Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow"
    start_year: 1965
    end_year: 1980
    description: "The Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow represented a revolutionary departure from the company's previous models, featuring unibody construction instead of body-on-frame and a more modern, streamlined design that reduced the car's footprint while maintaining interior space. Designed by John Polwhele Blatchley, the Silver Shadow's elegant, understated styling would influence luxury car design for decades. Initially powered by a 6.2-liter V8 (later enlarged to 6.75 liters), the Silver Shadow featured advanced technology for its era, including a high-pressure hydraulic system for the self-leveling suspension, disc brakes, and climate control. The interior maintained Rolls-Royce's tradition of handcrafted luxury with extensive use of leather, wood, and wool carpets, along with meticulous attention to detail. A long-wheelbase variant was introduced in 1969, and in 1971 the model received updates including a new front end and redesigned bumpers. The Silver Shadow II, introduced in 1977, featured further improvements including rack and pinion steering and modified front suspension. The convertible version, initially called the Silver Shadow Drophead Coupé, was renamed the Corniche in 1971 and continued production well beyond the Shadow's run. With over 30,000 units produced across all variants, the Silver Shadow was by far the most numerous Rolls-Royce model to that point, successfully broadening the brand's appeal while maintaining its exclusivity and luxury credentials."

  - name: "Rolls-Royce Phantom VII"
    start_year: 2003
    end_year: 2017
    description: "The Phantom VII marked the first all-new Rolls-Royce developed under BMW ownership after the German company acquired the rights to the Rolls-Royce name in 1998. Designed by Ian Cameron, the Phantom VII revived the imposing, stately presence of classic Rolls-Royce models while incorporating modern engineering and technology. Built on an aluminum space frame platform specifically developed for Rolls-Royce, the Phantom measured over 19 feet in length in standard form, with extended wheelbase versions adding another 10 inches. Power came from a naturally aspirated 6.75-liter V12 engine producing 453 horsepower (later increased to 460) paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission (later an 8-speed), delivering effortless performance despite the car's substantial 5,700+ pound weight. The interior represented the pinnacle of automotive luxury with book-matched wood veneers, hand-stitched leather from Alpine bulls (raised in an environment free from barbed wire to avoid hide imperfections), lambswool carpets, and a fiber-optic 'Starlight Headliner' that recreated a night sky on the ceiling. Traditional Rolls-Royce features were modernized, including self-leveling air suspension, coach (suicide) rear doors, and umbrellas stored within the doors. The Phantom VII range expanded to include a Drophead Coupé convertible in 2007 and a Coupé in 2008, both featuring unique design elements like teak decking and steel hood. The Phantom Series II update in 2012 brought subtle styling revisions, upgraded technology including a new infotainment system, and improved powertrain efficiency. With approximately 10,000 units produced across all variants, the Phantom VII successfully reestablished Rolls-Royce at the pinnacle of automotive luxury after a period of uncertainty, setting new standards for craftsmanship, refinement, and prestige."

  - name: "Rolls-Royce Phantom VIII"
    start_year: 2017
    end_year: null
    description: "The eighth-generation Phantom builds upon its predecessor's august reputation while thoroughly modernizing the flagship Rolls-Royce model. Built on the company's new aluminum 'Architecture of Luxury' platform, the Phantom VIII maintains similar dimensions to the previous generation but with improved structural rigidity and weight distribution. The exterior design, led by Giles Taylor, evolves the stately proportions with more seamless surfacing, a slightly more inclined Pantheon grille, and laser headlights. Power comes from a twin-turbocharged 6.75-liter V12 producing 563 horsepower and 664 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed ZF automatic transmission aided by GPS data to anticipate appropriate gear selections. The Phantom VIII sets new benchmarks for interior refinement with approximately 287 pounds of sound insulation, 6mm two-layer glazing, and foam-filled tires, resulting in what Rolls-Royce claims is the quietest car interior in the world. The most striking interior innovation is 'The Gallery'—a glass-enclosed space spanning the dashboard that can house bespoke artwork commissioned by the owner. Traditional luxury elements reach new heights with improved 'Starlight Headliner' with shooting star effects, rear privacy suite, picnic tables, and champagne cooler, while technology is discreetly integrated with a concealed infotainment system, digital instrumentation, and advanced driver assistance systems. Customization options are virtually limitless, with Rolls-Royce's Bespoke division capable of accommodating nearly any customer request, from unique paint formulations to personalized interior detailing. The Phantom VIII continues as the ultimate expression of automotive luxury, handcrafted at the company's Goodwood facility and representing the pinnacle of Rolls-Royce's 'Architecture of Luxury' that now underpins all of the marque's models."

  - name: "Rolls-Royce Ghost"
    start_year: 2010
    end_year: 2020
    description: "The first-generation Rolls-Royce Ghost was introduced as a slightly smaller, more driver-oriented complement to the flagship Phantom, though 'smaller' is relative in the context of Rolls-Royce, as the Ghost still measured 17.7 feet in length. Designed under the direction of Ian Cameron, the Ghost featured more understated styling compared to the Phantom, with less imposing proportions while maintaining key Rolls-Royce design elements including the Pantheon grille and rear-hinged 'coach' doors. Initially based on a modified platform shared with the BMW 7 Series, the Ghost nonetheless delivered a distinct character and driving experience appropriate to the Rolls-Royce brand. Power came from a twin-turbocharged 6.6-liter V12 producing 563 horsepower and 575 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission, enabling surprisingly spirited performance with 0-60 mph acceleration in under 4.8 seconds despite a curb weight exceeding 5,400 pounds. The interior maintained Rolls-Royce's standards of hand-crafted luxury with book-matched wood veneers, meticulously prepared leather, and wool carpets, while introducing a slightly more modern aesthetic than the Phantom. Technology was subtly integrated, with most controls concealed behind wooden panels when not in use. A significant update in 2014 (dubbed Series II) brought refined styling, updated technology, and suspension improvements. The model range expanded to include the extended wheelbase variant with an additional 6.7 inches of rear legroom, and special editions such as the V-Specification with additional power. The Ghost became Rolls-Royce's most successful model, appealing to a somewhat younger demographic and those who occasionally drive themselves rather than being exclusively chauffeur-driven."

  - name: "Rolls-Royce Ghost (Second Generation)"
    start_year: 2020
    end_year: null
    description: "The second-generation Rolls-Royce Ghost, introduced in 2020, represents a clean-sheet design with only the Spirit of Ecstasy emblem and umbrellas carried over from its predecessor. Built on Rolls-Royce's proprietary aluminum 'Architecture of Luxury' platform rather than sharing components with BMW, the new Ghost embodies the company's 'Post Opulence' design philosophy—a more minimalist, less ostentatious approach to luxury. The exterior features simplified surfacing with a single character line running the length of the car, illuminated grille, and wider stance. Power comes from a twin-turbocharged 6.75-liter V12 producing 563 horsepower and 627 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission and standard all-wheel drive—a first for the Ghost. The chassis incorporates an innovative 'Planar Suspension System' that includes a damper unit above the front suspension assembly and camera-based road-reading technology to provide an even more serene ride quality. The interior continues Rolls-Royce's tradition of handcrafted luxury but with a more minimalist aesthetic, featuring open-pore wood, hand-stitched leather, and metal accents. Over 220 pounds of sound insulation create an almost silent cabin, though engineers discovered this was actually disorienting and introduced a subtle 'whisper' – a soft undertone created by harmonizing various interior elements to vibrate at a specific frequency. Technology is discreetly integrated with a digital instrument cluster, head-up display, and the latest driver assistance systems. Available in standard and extended wheelbase versions, the second-generation Ghost advances Rolls-Royce's dual character as both a driver's car and a chauffeured experience, maintaining the brand's position at the pinnacle of automotive luxury while evolving its expression for a changing luxury market that increasingly values subtlety and restraint alongside traditional craftsmanship."

  - name: "Rolls-Royce Wraith"
    start_year: 2013
    end_year: 2023
    description: "The Rolls-Royce Wraith revived a historic nameplate as a dramatic fastback coupé representing the most dynamic and driver-focused model in the company's modern lineup. Based on a shortened version of the first-generation Ghost platform, the Wraith features unique styling with a sweeping roofline, frameless coach doors, and more muscular proportions. Powered by an uprated version of the Ghost's twin-turbocharged 6.6-liter V12 producing 624 horsepower and 605 lb-ft of torque, the Wraith can accelerate from 0-60 mph in 4.4 seconds—remarkable performance for a vehicle weighing over 5,300 pounds. The 8-speed automatic transmission incorporates GPS data to anticipate appropriate gear selections based on upcoming road conditions and driving style. The interior combines traditional Rolls-Royce craftsmanship with a somewhat sportier character, featuring book-matched wood veneers that sweep along the door panels and around the cabin in an unbroken line, 'Canadel' open-grain wood paneling, and the iconic Starlight Headliner with over 1,300 individually hand-placed fiber optic lights. The Wraith received various special editions throughout its production, including the performance-focused Black Badge variant with darkened chrome elements, unique interior treatments, and increased torque. The Wraith Collection editions offered highly limited configurations with exclusive aesthetic elements, while the Luminary Collection featured illuminated perforated wood veneer. Technological features include a head-up display, adaptive LED headlights, and a bespoke audio system. The Wraith represented a more personal, driver-oriented interpretation of Rolls-Royce luxury, appealing to a somewhat younger demographic while maintaining the brand's standards of hand-crafted exclusivity and refinement."

  - name: "Rolls-Royce Dawn"
    start_year: 2015
    end_year: 2023
    description: "The Rolls-Royce Dawn, introduced as a 2016 model, was developed as a drophead (convertible) companion to the Wraith coupé, though Rolls-Royce emphasized that 80% of the body panels were unique to create a distinct character. Designed to evoke the elegant Rolls-Royce Silver Dawn drophead of the 1950s, the modern Dawn features a meticulously tailored soft top that operates in complete silence in just 22 seconds at speeds up to 31 mph. The six-layer fabric roof provides coupe-like insulation when closed, while its operation was described by the company as a 'silent ballet.' Despite its sporting proportions, the Dawn is a true four-seater convertible with generous rear accommodations for adult passengers. Power comes from a twin-turbocharged 6.6-liter V12 producing 563 horsepower (593 in Black Badge form) and 575 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission that uses GPS data to predictively select gears. The interior showcases Rolls-Royce's handcrafted luxury with open-pore Canadel wood paneling, hand-stitched leather, and metal accents. Bespoke options are virtually limitless, from unique paint colors to personalized interior details. Like the Wraith, the Dawn was offered in Black Badge form with darkened chrome elements, technical fiber trim, and more assertive tuning. Special editions included the Dawn Silver Bullet Collection, limited to 50 examples featuring an Aero Cowling that converts the rear seats into a streamlined deck area. The Dawn represented Rolls-Royce's vision of the ultimate luxury convertible, combining open-air elegance with the refinement and craftsmanship expected of the marque."

  - name: "Rolls-Royce Cullinan"
    start_year: 2018
    end_year: null
    description: "The Rolls-Royce Cullinan marked the storied luxury manufacturer's first entry into the SUV market, named after the largest rough diamond ever discovered. Built on the same aluminum 'Architecture of Luxury' platform as the Phantom VIII, the Cullinan maintains distinctive Rolls-Royce design elements including the Pantheon grille, coach doors, and Spirit of Ecstasy emblem, adapted to a high-bodied vehicle format. Measuring 210 inches in length and standing 72 inches tall, the Cullinan presents an imposing presence, with a design that prioritizes formal elegance over aggressive styling commonly found in luxury SUVs. Power comes from a twin-turbocharged 6.75-liter V12 producing 563 horsepower (600 in Black Badge form) and 627 lb-ft of torque, paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission and standard all-wheel drive with an air suspension system that can raise the ride height for off-road use—though Rolls-Royce prefers the term 'all-terrain' to 'off-road.' The self-leveling air suspension proactively adjusts based on camera readings of the road ahead. The interior offers either a three-person rear bench or two individual rear seats separated by a fixed console containing a drinks cabinet. Unique features include a glass partition that can isolate the passenger compartment from the cargo area to maintain interior climate when the tailgate is open. The tailgate itself comes in a distinctive two-section 'clamshell' design, and can be optioned with the 'Viewing Suite'—two leather chairs and a cocktail table that deploy from the cargo area for elegant roadside viewing. Interior craftsmanship maintains Rolls-Royce's uncompromising standards with book-matched veneers, meticulously prepared leather, and metal accents. Technology includes night vision, a high-resolution head-up display, wildlife and pedestrian warning, and all-around visibility cameras. The Black Badge variant, introduced in 2019, features darkened chrome elements, technical carbon fiber trim, and more performance-oriented tuning. The Cullinan successfully transferred Rolls-Royce's luxury ethos to the SUV segment, offering unmistakable presence and comfort with genuine all-terrain capability."

  - name: "Rolls-Royce Spectre"
    start_year: 2023
    end_year: null
    description: "The Rolls-Royce Spectre represents a pivotal moment in the marque's 117-year history as its first fully electric production vehicle, described by the company as the spiritual successor to the Phantom Coupé. Built on the proprietary aluminum 'Architecture of Luxury' platform adapted for electrification, the Spectre is a dramatic fastback coupé measuring approximately 214 inches in length. The exterior design, led by Anders Warming, features the widest grille ever fitted to a Rolls-Royce, split headlight treatment, and the most aerodynamic body ever created by the brand with a drag coefficient of just 0.25. Power comes from a dual-motor electric drivetrain producing 577 horsepower and 664 lb-ft of torque, enabling 0-60 mph acceleration in 4.4 seconds despite a curb weight of nearly 6,000 pounds. The 102 kWh battery is integrated into the vehicle structure, providing an estimated range of 260-320 miles (WLTP) and supporting DC fast charging. The Spectre preserves signature Rolls-Royce elements including coach doors and the Starlight Headliner, while introducing new features such as Starlight Doors with 4,796 illuminated 'stars.' The interior combines traditional craftsmanship with advanced technology, featuring Rolls-Royce's digital architecture called 'Spirit' that manages over 1,000 functions and can send 25,000 messages through the vehicle systems. Despite its technical sophistication, the cabin maintains the serene, handcrafted luxury expected of the brand with book-matched veneers, meticulously prepared leather, and bespoke customization options. The Spectre's suspension uses sophisticated planar technology that decouples the anti-roll bars on straight roads for improved comfort, then reconnects them in corners for stability. The integration of the battery pack within the structure provides additional sound insulation, contributing to the hushed interior ambiance that has been a Rolls-Royce hallmark. As the vanguard of Rolls-Royce's commitment to full electrification by 2030, the Spectre maintains the brand's standards of excellence while embracing the advantages of electric propulsion—instant torque, silent operation, and smoothness—characteristics that align perfectly with the Rolls-Royce ethos of effortless performance."
