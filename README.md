The company is renowned for creating handcrafted luxury vehicles that epitomize excellence, sophistication, and British craftsmanship. Throughout its history, Rolls-Royce has maintained a reputation for engineering precision and luxury unmatched by most other automotive brands.

## Generations

### Early Period (1906-1939)

The early period of Rolls-Royce established the brand's reputation for engineering excellence. Key models included:

- **Phantom I (1925-1929)**: Succeeded the Silver Ghost, featuring a new 7.7L six-cylinder engine with pushrod-operated overhead valves.
- **Phantom II & III (1929-1939)**: Continued refinement of the Phantom line, with the Phantom III introducing a V12 engine.

### Post-War Period (1946-1971)

Following World War II, Rolls-Royce continued producing luxury vehicles while adapting to changing market conditions:

- **Silver Dawn (1949-1955)**: First Rolls-Royce to offer a factory-built standard steel body.
